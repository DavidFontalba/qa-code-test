## QA Code test. 

Welcome to this QA code test! :)

The main objective of this technical exercise is for you to get a good grasp of what kind of problems we encounter on Genially. We would not want you to find some nasty surprises if you decide to join us. Also, it's a good starting point to have a technical conversation during an interview.

# Test exercises.

## Exercise 1: Manual testing. 

Visit the Genially website: https://genial.ly  

We just released a new version and we want to make sure everything is working properly for our users. In order to do that, we need you to create and define the 5 tests you would do to make sure that the web is working as expected and none of our customers is blocked by a bug. 

Please, use the following format to define your tests: 

- Title
- Type: acceptance, regression...
- Priority
- Browser and Operative System. 
- Pre-conditions (if any)
- Description. 
- Steps to reproduce and expected result as detailed as possible. For example: 

|STEP |RESULT|
|-----|--------|
|Visit the Genially web.|The page is displayed properly on the browser. |

You can write the test plan by using *Markdown, Google Docs, Microsoft Office…* but please, do not forget to upload the document into this repository. 

### Extra points. 

This part is not mandatory, but, if you want to add extra points to this exercise you can:

- If you find any issue/bug/error doing these tests and you report us, you will get extra points. 
- If you use any Test Management Tool, such as *Jira, TestRail, Qase…* you will get extra points for the effort. 


## Exercise 2: Automation testing. 

After defining the acceptance tests on Exercise 1, we would like you to **automate** those tests to check your automation skills. 

To start this exercise, please, create a new **NPM** project and then: 

- Install **Cypress** framework. 
- Remove the specs and examples by default from the Cypress installation. We only want to see your code on the repo. 
- You can choose between Javascript or Typescript to do this project. 
- Add the plugins/libraries you need to the project and tell us why you need them. 
- Create configuration files in case you need them. 
- Define Chrome as the custom browser to run the tests on the `package.json` file. 
- Create custom commands for the actions you need. 

Do not forget to…

- Add all the assertions necessary to make sure that the app is displayed and works properly. 
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc on each method. 
- Create a `README.md` file explaining how to run the test and the project structure. 

### Extra points. 

This part is not mandatory, but, if you want to add extra points to this exercise you can:

- Analyze your code with Sonar or Lint. fix the issues and share the results with us. 
- You can integrate this project with the CI provider of your choice (Github Actions, Jenkins, Gitlab…) to run the test. 


# Delivery method

Send it to us however it suits you, but our preferred method is to get access to a private fork of the repo. This way, we can see historical changes and a complete diff against the original repo on a PR. It's also a great way to write down feedback and discussion points for the interview afterwards.

If you opt for a fork with limited access, see the contact list below for people you can give access to.
