# Test exercises.

## Exercise 1: Manual testing. 

The 5 tests created and defined for the first exercise can be found in doc/PR00001_PRO_QACodeTest.pdf

## Exercise 2: Automation testing. 

The first three tests can be found in cypress/integration/FUN001PresentationManagement.spec.js

To run the Test you have to write on the terminal " npm run runTests "

I used the plugin "cypress-real-events" https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/cypress-real-events because I needed
the behaviour of hover. I managed it in the MainPage.js to use the method realHover

There left two more tests to develop, related to FUN002AccountManagement, so this exercise still remains WIP
